Flesch Reading Ease test
--------------------

Higher scores indicate material that is easier to read; lower numbers mark passages that are more difficult to read.

| Score | Notes |
| ----- | ----- |
| 90.0–100.0 | easily understood by an average 11-year-old student |
| 60.0–70.0 | easily understood by 13- to 15-year-old students |
| 0.0–30.0 | best understood by university graduates |

Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level
-------------------

These readability tests are used extensively in the field of education.
The "Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level Formula" instead presents a score as a U.S. grade level,
making it easier for teachers, parents, librarians, and others to judge the readability level of various books and texts.

Automated Readability Index
--------------------

The Automated Readability Index (ARI) is a readability test designed to assess the understandability of a text.
Index is derived from ratios representing word difficulty (number of letters per word) and sentence difficulty (number of words per sentence).
